# DATA2001 - Introduction to Data Science
---
This course focused on three main areas of data science.

### A1 Hindsight
This assignment was my first introduction to the data science process, working on analysing structured data with the 6
subtasks of:
1. Data Preparation
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Simple Statistical Analysis
4. Correlation Analysis
5. Performing K-Means Clustering
6. Performing Principal Component Analysis

### A2 Insight
Insight was all about gaining insight where I gained experience in analysing unstructured
data and focused on the five tasks of:
1. Data Exploration
2. Data Preprocesssing
3. Model Training
4. Model Evaluation
5. Model Analysis

### A3
A3's assignment was all about foresight. This task involves exploring an unemployment data set
gathered from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. 

Three datasets gathers from the ABS where utilised to explore historical trends and build a robust
forecasting model to predict future unemployement rates.

This assignment out of the 3 was the most interesting and it was the chance to explore and apply an entire semesters
worth of data science knowledge and involved more of my personal favourite tasks of writing code to assist with 
explanation and analysis.
